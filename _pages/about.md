I'm a second year graduate student working in the [Gremel lab](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/cgremel.html) at the University of California San Diego (the weather really is as lovely as everyone says it is!). Currently, I'm working on trying to understand how alcohol impacts parts of the brain important for decision-making, like the [orbitofrontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitofrontal_cortex). (Spoilerâ€”it certainly doesn't make it better!) For a list of posters and publications, check out my [CV](/CV).

Another fun and important part of my work is assistant teaching. Take a look at my [teaching experience](/teachingExperience), if you're interested.
