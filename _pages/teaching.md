## Student Evaluations

- "She was wonderful! I asked her questions at review sessions, before and after class, and at office hours. She was very helpful, especially since sometimes the professor was taking a lot of questions so I asked her instead and I got my answer. She was also very enthusiastic about the topics we discussed and made it all seem really interesting and like a bunch of fun to learn."
- "Chloe was great! She helped me out so much during this class. She was well versed in topics throughout the class and was great at instructing
- "Fabulous TA! So patient and kind! Thank you for your help!"
- "Really loved and understood your guest lectures very well!!"
