## Student Evaluations

- "Chloe showed a genuine interest to teach and a real excitement about the material she presented. She showed up 100% for every review session and gave a clear presentation in class about intelligence testing. She provided useful examples to clarify ideas, encouraged student input, and organized slides in a clear manner. I really appreciated Chloe's participation in this course and learned a lot from her."
- "Chloe was wonderful! She was very enthusiastic about the topics we discussed and made it all seem really interesting and like a bunch of fun to learn."

## Instructor Evaluations
- "Chloe is already a polished instructor and one of the best TAs I've ever had. Don't get me started on her lecture covering executive system function/dysfunction. One of the best - she was poised, relaxed, great pace, used humor. A natural, I was floored. I would have her back in my classroom at any time."
- "Chloe is an outstanding GTA. Her knowledge, organization, and promptness really enhanced the class."
