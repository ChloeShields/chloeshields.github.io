# Hello there!

My name is Chloe Shields. I'm a second year graduate student working in the [Gremel lab](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/cgremel.html) at the University of California San Diego (the weather sure is nice). I do neuroscience research, which is fun because I share my initials with the [Central Nervous System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system). Currently, I'm working on trying to understand how alcohol impacts parts of the brain important for decision-making, like the [orbitofrontal cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbitofrontal_cortex). (Spoilerâ€”it certainly doesn't make it better!) For a list of posters and publications, check out my [CV](/CV).

Another fun and important part of my work is assistant teaching. Take a look at my [teaching experience](/teachingExperience), if you're interested.
